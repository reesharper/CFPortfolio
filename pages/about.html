        <p>
          I chose Lambda because I wanted to find a way into the tech industry.
          I kept searching for the right role to play in the industry bouncing
          from sound production to videography to video editing in different
          jobs and volenteer rolls, yet none of them gave me excitement as a
          career. Then my cousin who had been studying computer science at
          Belmont University proposed the idea of Lambda School. I had been out
          of school for a year deciding whether to go back and he was looking
          for a different program to pursue his passion for computer science. We
          pondered the idea for a while, then COVID-19 hit. This solidified our
          decision, picking a 9 month program that is built to be online costing
          a fraction of the price over a 4 year university that is scrambling to
          make online its primary learning structure was a non starter. Lambda
          it is!
